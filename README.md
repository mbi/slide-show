# `<slide-show>`
A standalone `<slide-show>` custom element, whose content is displayed as scroll-snapped carousel slides. 

### Build

```cli
> make
```

Builds production files to the `build/` folder, and documentation to `index.html`. 

The process requires you to have _Deno_ installed. It launches *esbuild* to import and compile JS and CSS modules, and *literal* to compile documentation.
